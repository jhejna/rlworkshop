It's a great opportunity to practice designing parts of your network and Googling the appropriate Pytorch (or Numpy, if needed) methods/classes that you'll need to implement it. That said, if you get stuck, definitely ask other workshop attendees or presenters for help!\n",

This means we will need to output a categorical distribution. Think about the best way to implement this. (Hint: treat it like a classification problem). Your solution should ideally work for a discrete action space of any size, even though CartPole has only two actions.\n",
        "\n",
